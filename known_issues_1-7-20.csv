Ligation L2245 blasts to a damsel fish.  It is also hard to believe that while I was separating out vials of clownfish and anemones and labeling them as such, I would mistake an anemone sample for a clownfish sample.  I think that a clownfish sample was collected but not recorded on the data sheet."
