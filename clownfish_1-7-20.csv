Malin thinks he grabbed the 78 vial but saw and recorded 93.  The fin clip in vial APCL12_078 genetically matches APCL13_187.  This sample was recorded in a location that has only reef between it and the location where APCL13_187 was collected.  The other APCL12_093 was collected across a sandy patch.  Because of this, it is believed that this is the finclip placed in the 78 vial.  It is possible that in fact the sample that is still in the database as APCL12_093 was the finclip placed in the 78 vial.  See Evernote APCL12_078 for more details.  Changed fin_id from 93 to 78.  Changed sample_id from APCL12_093 to APCL12_078.  Changed capid from NULL to 9."
