"2017-09-19","MRS","GPX table crashed, restored from backup  - GPX_9-5-172-13 PM.sql"
"2017-09-20","MRS","Discovered that 2016-06-06 through the end of the 2016 season incorrectly assigned the unit of the gps on the GPX table.  Changed the unit from 3 to 4 for all rows of the GPX table that are between those dates."
"2017-09-20","MRS","Discovered that June 15 and June 13 2017 from unit 5 were not imported, adding now."
"2017-09-21","MRS","Fixed erroneous entries in 2017 anemone data and type-os, added anem_obs to anem_table"
"2017-09-25","MRS","Fixed divetypes for  2014-2017 dives"
"2017-09-28","MRS","Removed all 2017 anemone and clownfish table data and rebuilt because there were duplicates due to some rows of data being entered into the anemone excel sheet more than once."
"2017-10-06","MRS","Converted diveinfo column names to standard format of lower case, words spaced with under scores as I mentioned I would be doing in our clownfish user meeting."
"2017-10-06","MRS","Discovered that there are no anem_table_ids for the fish captured in 2017.  Deleted all rows from 2017 in anemone and clownfish tables and rebuilt code, re-imported. - finished 2017-10-07."
"2017-10-06","MRS","Discovered duplicated anem_table_ids - these rows were exact replicas except for anem_obs.  I think there is a problem in the anem_obs code that created the duplicates.  Removed duplicate rows, in the process of fixing the anem_obs code."
"2017-10-11","MRS","Newly imported 2017 fish do not have sample_ids."
"2017-11-01","MRS","Moved known issues table and meta data  from Leyte database to Laboratory database"
"2018-01-10","MRS","Added more pitscan data - still missing a few days in June 2017"
"2018-01-16","MRS","Added pitscan data through 2017-06-15; this should be the final addition for the 2017 season.  Also made some type-o corrections"
"2018-01-16","MRS","Added notes to pitscan data to indicate pre-dive scans, these tags are not necessarily in fish, but could be based on datasheet."
"2018-01-18","MRS","Changed anem_id column type from text to double and changed anem_obs from decimal to double with no specified length"
"2018-04-20","MRS","Added 2018 field data, collector is missing and needs to be fixed"
"2018-05-07","MRS","created a fish_estimates table, now clownfish is only fish where a fish was measured and/or a tissue sample was collected and fish_estimates are all of the fish we wrote down without catching."
"2018-05-10","MRS","removed duplicated GPX rows for 2018 field season, gps unit 6, caused by the unit generating duplicate files daily."
"2018-07-12","MRS","Added anem and fish collectors to 2018 data, removed some rows of duplicated data from 2018 "
"2018-09-27","MRS","Replaced cap_id with gen_id - this identifier indicates that a sample was successfully sequenced through Michelle's filters.  Genetic identity matches have the same gen_id, even though they have different ligation_ids and sample_ids.  "
"2019-01-03","MRS","Added gen_ids for fish that were in the seq28-33 sequencing runs"
"2019-02-25","MRS","Renamed various table \"notes\" column with prefix matching table, so that when fish, anem, and dive tables are merged, their notes columns remain distinct."
