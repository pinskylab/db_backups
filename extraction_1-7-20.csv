This sample failed to sequence.  When I went to add a note about failed sequencing to the Leyte database, APCL14_131 is not in the Leyte database because the sample # 131 collected in 2014 was an anemone, not a clownfish.  Ligation L2245 blasts to a damsel fish.  It is also hard to believe that while I was separating out vials of clownfish and anemones and labeling them as such, I would mistake an anemone sample for a clownfish sample.  If vial 131 did indeed contain anemone tissue, that tissue has long since dissolved.  Would like to sequence the mucus in the tube to see if we can get a match - or PCR???

2016-01-04: Changed sample ID from APCL14_132 to APCL13_131 because there was no APCL14_131 on the plate map but there was an empty vial marked A. clarkii APCL14_131 in the empty tube box.
